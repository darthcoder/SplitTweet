# SplitTweet
Splits a long sentence to send as tweets

There is both a js version and python version. these are command-line utilities and lack (as of now) a gui. 

The js version is buggy in that it splits the tweets alright but it sends them in a random order which i guess 
is due to its async nature.

Python version works as expected. 

Requires generation of twitter api keys and consumer keys. these can be generated on dev.twitter.com
